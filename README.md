### What I learned

In HTML, I learned that the HR tag creates a horizontal line, and figured out the importance of proper class naming conventions for descriptive and meaningful names in lowercase with hyphens. Additionally, I discovered how to place an SVG icon next to a P tag by utilizing the DIV element and applying CSS.

In terms of CSS, I explored the font-weight property, which controls the thickness of a font. I also delved into creating box shadows around elements using the box-shadow property. I learned that it is possible to have box shadows on both the left and right sides of an element by using multiple box-shadow declarations. Moreover, I explored aligning an SVG icon and text vertically using flexbox properties, such as display: flex; and align-items: center;.

Furthermore, I discovered how to incorporate the "Outfit" font family into your webpage. By adding the appropriate Google Fonts LINK to your HTML, you can apply the "Outfit" font family to all text on your webpage using the font-family property in CSS.

By applying this newfound knowledge, I learned that I can create visually appealing web pages with horizontal lines, properly named classes, styled fonts, box shadows, and aligned SVG icons alongside text.
